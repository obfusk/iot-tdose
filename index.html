* what I want to talk about today
* the IoT is around the corner
* computers seem to be everywhere (pocket, desk, cloud)
* will really be everywhere (environment, bodies)
* what does this mean?
* for us as software developers?
* what are the dangers and opportunities when it comes to freedom,
  privacy, and security?

### IoT Criticism and Controversies

.large[

* Privacy, autonomy and control
* Security (too often an afterthought)

<!-- -->

* Who controls the computers?
* Control / Trust / Freedom
* Free Software

<!-- -->

* Public Safety /  Human Life / Democracy
* Accountability / Transparency / Reviewability
* Incompetence vs Malice
* The Human Factor

]

???

* priv: where we are, what we do, invasive (not just "online")
* sec: pacemakers, insulin pumps, traffic lights
* invisible / M2M / networks / protocols
* "hacker mentality"
* ownership

But security is too often an afterthought (if that). Now that the IoT
is around the corner, security is not just something that impacts
those beige boxes on our desks -- or the smartphones we carry around
-- but also the **medical devices** that **monitor our health and keep
us alive**, the **automobiles we drive**, the **electronics that
monitor our homes**, and the **public infrastructure we depend on**.
It now impacts **public safety, human life, privacy, freedom and
democracy**.

---

## ACLU:

> "There's simply no way to forecast how these **immense powers** --
**disproportionately** accumulating in the hands of corporations
seeking financial advantage and governments craving ever more control
-- will be used. Chances are Big Data and the Internet of Things will
make it harder for us to **control our own lives**, as we grow
increasingly **transparent to powerful corporations and government
institutions** that are becoming **more opaque to us**."
